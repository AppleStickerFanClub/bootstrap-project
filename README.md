# bootstrap-project

A little windows batch file that helps with setting the github user.name and user.email fields. 


Edit the file to use your actual email address that you used to sign up for github with for user.email, 
and your preferred username for user.name.


Git uses these values in every commit, you will usually only need to set them if you're on a brand new computer 
...or in a computer lab ;)
